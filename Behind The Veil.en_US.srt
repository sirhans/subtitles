00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,089
- [Male Narrator] Behind the veil

2
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:51,630
of all the mystical allegories

3
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,890
of the world's great religions,

4
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,120
there has been a single
great religious truth,

5
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,543
the universal source of all religions.

6
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,190
Hidden in the silent faces

7
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,570
of Egyptian monuments under
the gaze of the Vedic gods,

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,600
between the lines of
the old books of Alchemy

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,540
and tantalizing us from the
myths of the Aztecs and Mayans,

10
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,830
the essence of the doctrine
has always been there

11
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,783
but few have understood it.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,880
Throughout the history of humanity,

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,850
only the elect few were
initiated into the mysteries

14
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,903
of this great universal truth.

15
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,090
And those few guided the rest of humanity

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,753
and gave them the outward symbols
of that truth as guidance.

17
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,250
Entire civilizations were
destroyed or disappeared

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,430
when the divine knowledge they
had been given degenerated

19
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,253
into desire, lust, greed, anger or pride.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,810
For centuries the knowledge
was protected in this way

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,720
but as humanity degenerated
into barbarism and cruelty,

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,200
the divine knowledge went
underground and it survived

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,723
in isolated pockets around
the world for centuries.

24
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,620
This knowledge is universal and applies

25
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,613
to all true religions
and mystical traditions.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Whether it is the serpent of Adam and Eve

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,130
in the Judeo Christian tradition,

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,453
the winged serpent Quetzalcoatl
from the Aztec tradition,

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,610
the serpents climbing the
Caduceus of the Greek God Hermes

30
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,540
or the serpents of the Hindu
or Buddhist traditions.

31
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,563
All these symbols contain
the same teaching.

32
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,923
The time has come for this
hidden doctrine to be revealed.

33
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:54,260
(mid tempo music)

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,270
The Old Testament or Torah
presents an outward appearance

35
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,640
in the form of stories and histories

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,680
and it gives basic spiritual instruction.

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,810
But in truth, it is a vehicle
of the inner knowledge

38
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,053
but only those who had the
keys can understand it.

39
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,610
This book was given to humanity
by Moses who was raised

40
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,530
to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

41
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,863
Thus he knew all the
hidden wisdom of Egypt.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,900
That knowledge is concealed in the Bible,

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,100
the Torah or the Tanakh and
in the books of Judaism.

44
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,613
But there are a few with
the keys to access it.

45
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,267
As the Hebrew Zohar says,

46
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,887
- [Female Narrator] "The
narratives of the doctrine

47
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,047
"are it's cloak.

48
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:46,257
"The simple look only at the garment

49
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,787
"that is upon the
narrative of the doctrine,

50
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:50,507
"more they know not.

51
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:54,047
"The instructed however,
see not merely the cloak,

52
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,847
"but what the cloak covers."

53
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,650
- [Male Narrator] The Bible is symbolic.

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,070
Because the inner knowledge
has been hidden, rejected, lost

55
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,250
or forgotten, the Bible like
all great religious books

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,780
has been interpreted literally.

57
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,630
This is the traditional
understanding of religion,

58
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,983
the outward or exoteric
teachings, the cloak.

59
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,720
But it is only the inner knowledge
that can redeem the soul.

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,430
Even Jesus of Nazareth
taught both a public

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,673
and a secret doctrine.

62
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,617
- [Female Narrator] "To
you it hath been given

63
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,607
"to know the secrets of
the reign of the heavens

64
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,840
"and to these it hath not been given."

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,900
- [Male Narrator] But humanity could not

66
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,340
accept his teachings and
over the last 2000 years,

67
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,640
the esoteric knowledge

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,763
that he taught has been
edited out or forgotten.

69
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,730
And those who held

70
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,193
to his real teachings
were persecuted or killed.

71
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,928
(mid tempo music)

72
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:04,087
- [Female Narrator]
"For narrow is the gate

73
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,873
"and straightened the
way that leads to life

74
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,937
"and they are few who find it."

75
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,501
(somber music)

76
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,590
- [Male Narrator] Though the modern Bible

77
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,120
is greatly disfigured, the
ancient secret doctrine can still

78
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,993
be found in it.

79
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,360
The very first words of the Bible

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,397
in Hebrew are (speaking
in foreign language).

81
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,070
The common literal translation

82
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,780
is, in the beginning God creates.

83
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,180
But the esoteric translation found

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,967
in the Zohar reads, "In
wisdom, Elohim creates."

85
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,023
Elohim is a Hebrew word.

86
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,230
The root El is Hebrew
for God and is masculine.

87
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,020
The feminine form of El is
Eloah which means goddess.

88
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,460
Elohim is plural

89
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,933
thus meaning gods and
goddesses, male, female.

90
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,910
This indicates immediately
that God is male, female.

91
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,700
In contrast to the familiar
image of a bearded old man,

92
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,660
God is established in the
first three words of the Bible

93
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,843
as androgynous, containing
both male and female.

94
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,420
The word Elohim also refers to angels,

95
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,943
the governors of creation.

96
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,913
These angels are male, female
in the image of their creator.

97
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,680
This is why most ancient
images of angels show them

98
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,263
as having attributes
of both men and women.

99
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,653
Jehovah Elohim is the regent of Eden.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,623
The angel who oversaw
the creation of humanity.

101
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,907
- [Female Narrator] "Jehovah
Elohim formed man from the dust

102
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,127
"of the earth.

103
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,857
"He blew into his nostrils,
the breath of life

104
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,717
"and man became a living being."

105
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,920
- [Male Narrator] Jehovah is
another important name of God,

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,793
not to be confused with Jahveh.

107
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,120
The name Jehovah or Jehovah is comprised

108
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,120
of four Hebrew letters, Yod,
he, vav, he and can be read

109
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,700
with many different
pronunciations and meanings,

110
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,250
Jehovah, Jodheve, Jahveh.

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,593
Each one very different in meaning.

112
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:15,777
Yod or Jah can be translated
as male or phallus, Adam.

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
And Heva, or Heve is female,
mother or uterus, Eve.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,260
And so the Elohim, the
angel Jehovah formed a man

115
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,823
in his image androgynous.

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,860
Thus as recorded in the esoteric heart

117
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,963
of all great religions,

118
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:46,930
humanity symbolized by
Adam was once androgynous,

119
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,849
containing both male and female.

120
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:52,432
(gentle music)

121
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,837
- [Female Narrator] "And
Jehovah Elohim planted a garden

122
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,217
"eastward of Eden.

123
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:08,560
"And there he put the man

124
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,007
whom he had formed."

125
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,360
- [Male Narrator] Eden,
the primordial paradise

126
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,213
is remembered around the world.

127
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,970
Eden is symbolic of the
innocence and happiness

128
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,193
that was once the natural
state of humanity.

129
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,100
The humanity of Eden

130
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,000
was pure knowing only goodness and virtue.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,510
Being reflections of God, they
embodied the seven virtues

132
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,343
of the soul.

133
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,040
But Eden is also a real place
although it never existed

134
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,970
in the physical world.

135
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,720
According to esoteric wisdom,

136
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,600
there exists seven fundamental
dimensions of ascending

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,763
and descending order.

138
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,600
The ascent and descent through
these realms by the beings

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
that inhabit them is represented

140
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,423
in the Bible by Jacob's ladder.

141
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,990
When Jehovah Elohim created
Adam, he placed Adam

142
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,810
in the garden of Eden.

143
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,010
This is the fourth dimension,
the world of vital energy.

144
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,483
This is the Yesod which
means the foundation.

145
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,443
It exists in a superior dimension
beyond the physical world.

146
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,420
Adam symbolizes humanity as a race.

147
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,740
And though they were
happy in their innocence,

148
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,683
they needed to grow spiritually.

149
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,153
So Eve was drawn from the body of Adam.

150
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,507
- [Female Narrator] "Jehovah
Elohim took one of man's ribs

151
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,937
"and closed up the place with flesh.

152
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,027
"Then Jehovah Elohim made a woman

153
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,547
"from the rib he had taken out of the man.

154
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:05,880
"She shall be called woman
for she was taken out of man."

155
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,690
- [Male Narrator] Thus the human
hermaphrodite was separated

156
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,950
into two sexes, male and female

157
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,430
in order that they may
see themselves better

158
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,500
to know themselves.

159
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,990
Since that time, man and woman have sought

160
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,460
to reclaim their missing unity

161
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,603
which is the root of the
craving for sexual connection.

162
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,500
- [Female Narrator] "For this reason,

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,627
"a man leave his father and
mother and be united to his wife

164
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,527
"and they will become one flesh."

165
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,270
(mid tempo music)

166
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,127
"And out of the ground made Jehovah Elohim

167
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:13,177
"to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the sight

168
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:14,737
"and good for food.

169

"With the tree of life also
in the midst of the garden

00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,120
"and the tree of knowledge

171
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,230
of good and bad."

172
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,810
- [Male Narrator] The tree
of life is an ancient symbol

173
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,380
and is found in all the cultures

174
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,253
who have held the esoteric knowledge.

175
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,330
In the mystical tradition
of Kabbalah it is a map

176
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,883
of the universe and of the human soul.

177
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,640
This is the same tree
that Moses found burning

178
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,320
on Mount Sinai.

179
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,153
This is the tree

180
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,623
from which the trader Judas
Iscariot hung himself.

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,640
This is the tree under

182
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,323
which the Buddha Shakyamuni
found enlightenment.

183
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,463
This is the world tree of the Maya,

184
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,603
the tree of life of the Aztecs,

185
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,600
the great Nordic tree Yggdrasill

186
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,203
that supports existence
in its powerful bows.

187
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,270
Just as the tree of life
maps the macrocosmos,

188
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,270
the universe around us so it
also maps the microcosmos man,

189
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,853
the reflection of the
universe, as above, so below.

190
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,250
The tree of life symbolizes the structure

191
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,993
of the soul and the structure of creation.

192
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,920
Its roots are in the highest
realms and its branches

193
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,840
and leaves are all the worlds
and the many beings who exist.

194
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,010
This tree gives forth
fruit, life, sustenance,

195
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,193
the light of Christ.

196
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,723
It is even the symbolic
origin of the Christmas tree.

197
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,980
The fruit from the tree
of life is divine food,

198
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,533
blessings for the soul.

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,800
By eating the fruit from the tree of life,

200
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,740
Adam and Eve were obedient to divine will,

201
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,070
feeding themselves with divine knowledge

202
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,840
and thus strengthening their relationship

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,860
with God in all existence.

204
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,440
This is represented in the
Bible through their abilities

205
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,240
to walk and talk with God
and command the animals

206
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,633
and plants in nature.

207
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,523
Abilities humanity has long since lost.

208
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,450
Having an illuminated
tree of life within means

209
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,320
that one perceives all
the realms of nature

210
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,773
and enjoys the love and happiness
of knowing God directly.

211
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,653
Of this tree, Adam and
Eve could freely eat.

212
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,890
But there existed another tree in Eden,

213
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,713
the tree of knowledge.

214
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,487
- [Female Narrator] "And Jehovah Elohim

215
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,067
"commanded the man saying,
'Of every tree of the garden,

216
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,340
"'You are free to eat.

217
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,027
"'But as for the tree of
knowledge, of good and bad,

218
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,270
"'you must not eat of it for
as soon as you eat of it,

219
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,690
"'you shall die.'"

220
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,113
- [Male Narrator] It is clear

221
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,650
that the tree of knowledge was forbidden

222
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,970
to Adam and Eve yet they
were tempted by the one thing

223
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,993
in all of paradise that was taboo.

224
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,393
The Hebrew word for knowledge is daath.

225
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,410
Daath is the hidden sphere
found in the Kabbalah

226
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,563
which traditionally is never
spoken of nor revealed.

227
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,180
However, use of the word
knowledge is always very specific

228
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,013
in the Bible.

229
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,237
- [Female Narrator]
"Adam knew his wife again

230
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:34,127
"and she bore a son.

231
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,157
"The maiden was very beautiful,

232
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,757
"a virgin who no man had known."

233
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,670
- [Male Narrator] It is
clear to the observant reader

234
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,510
that knowledge in the Bible
always relates to sexuality

235
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,650
hence the tree of knowledge

236
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,073
is a direct reference to sexuality.

237
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,840
What then is the purpose
of this reference to sex

238
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,513
and its role in the fate of Adam and Eve?

239
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,490
When humanity was physically separated

240
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,640
into two sexes, man
and woman still carried

241
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,883
within them the reflection
of their creator.

242
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,820
Within every male there
still exists a female aspect.

243
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,380
And in every woman an
aspect which is male.

244
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,020
By this level of meaning,

245
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,010
Adam and Eve symbolize
the subtle physiology

246
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,843
of the individual.

247
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,100
The ancient symbol

248
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,630
of the Caduceus illustrates
this male, female polarity

249
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,073
in the individual person.

250
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,830
This symbol commonly associated

251
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,050
with the Greek God Hermes
is visible in the records

252
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,843
of countless ancient
cultures such as Aztec,

253
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,147
Egyptian, Hindu, Greek,

254
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,323
Chinese and Assyrian.

255
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,960
The two serpents have
always symbolized the male

256
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,350
and female energetic channels
that wind up the spine.

257
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,080
As they are energetic not physical,

258
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,560
a scalpel will never find them.

259
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,240
Their root is Yesod in the physical body,

260
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,763
the sexual organs and they
are fed by the sexual energy.

261
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,740
These two channels

262
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,740
of energy are called Ida
and Pingala in Sanskrit.

263
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,473
In the Kabbalah they're
called Ohd and Ohm.

264
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,663
And an esoteric Christianity
they're called Adam and Eve.

265
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,287
- [Female Narrator] "These
are the two olive trees

266
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,277
"and the two candle sticks
standing before the God

267
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,377
"of the earth."

268
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,120
- [Male Narrator] The two
serpents wind up the spinal column

269
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,473
of the physical body.

270
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,080
The spine is symbolized by a staff

271
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,963
or a rod.

272
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,810
The spine has 33 vertebrae
symbolized by the 33 years

273
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,070
of the life of Jesus of Nazareth

274
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,673
and by the 33 degrees of the masons.

275
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,020
On either side of this rod,

276
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,260
the spinal column are two serpents.

277
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,373
Pingala is the male aspect Adam.

278
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,888
Ida is the female aspect Eve.

279
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,643
And it is Eve that drives procreation.

280
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,610
Temptation arose in
humanity out of the desire

281
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,570
to have their own children
without the guidance

282
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,360
of the Elohim.

283
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,390
Eve, the feminine serpent
of the internal bipolarity

284
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,610
is the channel of energy
that pushes for procreation

285
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,640
in both men and women.

286
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,750
Human beings chose to
procreate of their own will.

287
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,690
In their innocence however,

288
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,930
they did not realize

289
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,383
that the laws they were given
were for their own good.

290
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,510
Learning to procreate without
the guidance of the Elohim led

291
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,410
to the discovery of the orgasm.

292
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,160
(dramatic music)

293
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,410
The tree of knowledge or sexuality

294
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,800
was present alongside all the
other aspects of existence.

295
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,410
It is even recognized
as an important presence

296
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,050
in Eden alongside the tree of life.

297
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,410
And in the tradition of the Kabbalah,

298
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,433
these two trees are said
to share the same roots.

299
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,400
However, unlike any other tree in Eden,

300
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,040
Adam and Eve were only allowed

301
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,390
to enjoy the tree of
knowledge without indulging

302
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,253
in its fruit.

303
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,457
- [Female Narrator] "For
as soon as you eat of it,

304
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:19,737
"you shall die."

305
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,790
- [Male Narrator] While in Eden,

306
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,160
Adam and Eve only knew
divinity and innocence

307
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,313
and thus inherently respected
the laws of creation.

308
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,100
In their innocence, they were
ignorant of the consequences

309
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,483
of indulging in the fruit of sexuality.

310
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,620
Tremendous energy is harnessed

311
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,283
in the sexual act between
a man and a woman.

312
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,650
It is in this coitus

313
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,243
that humanity has the God
given capacity to create.

314
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,300
Man as active force, the
reflection of God the Father,

315
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,300
woman as receptive force, the
reflection of God the mother

316
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,503
and sex as the force that
brings them together.

317
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,250
Sexual energy is electricity
that is symbolized by fire,

318
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,750
by water and by light.

319
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,983
These symbols exist in the
traditions of the Bible,

320
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,313
Alchemy, the Mayans,

321
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,807
the Buddhists, the Hindu, et cetera.

322
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,350
The ancient ritual of baptism is a symbol

323
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,120
of the transmutation of sexual energy,

324
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,573
The source of salvation.

325
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,373
From the tree of life
flow the waters of life,

326
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,530
the waters of the sexual energy

327
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,233
and the force that creates all existence.

328
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,203
All life is born of the sexual waters.

329
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,200
The power of creation harnessing the force

330
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,193
of that electric energy
implies a great responsibility.

331
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,090
It was very important
that the tremendous energy

332
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,770
that gave mankind the ability
to create be used efficiently

333
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,810
because it was connected
to the same energetic force

334
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,623
that sustained the
individual's own vitality.

335
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,670
Not only was it necessary for
sustaining physical vitality

336
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,510
and thus the five physical senses

337
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,070
but also the vitality of
the seven superior senses,

338
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,483
the united mankind to the divine.

339
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,400
At the time of Adam and Eve,

340
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,750
sex was practiced only in the
temples under the guidance

341
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,763
of the Elohim.

342
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,520
The Archangel Gabriel
and his legions of angels

343
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,680
were guiding humanity in this Holy ritual

344
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,560
as indicated by his
recurrence in the Bible,

345
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,373
announcing the arrival of children.

346
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,670
Thus the angels supervise
this Holy sacrament

347
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,270
and guided a single sperm to meet an egg

348
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,950
in the precise moment needed
to engender a deliberate

349
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,453
and divine child.

350
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,370
This is in fact the hidden meaning

351
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,543
of the term immaculate conception.

352
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,513
Immaculate means perfectly clean.

353
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:41,417
- [Female Narrator] "When a
man has an emission of semen,

354
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,577
"he shall bathe his whole body in water

355
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:46,087
"and remain unclean until evening."

356
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,300
- [Male Narrator] Sex was
treated with the utmost respect

357
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,970
and the orgasm was unknown
to mankind before the abuse

358
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,533
of the tree of knowledge.

359
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,320
Husband joined wife in the
sexual act in accordance

360
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,933
with the laws given to
them by Jehovah Elohim.

361
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,980
They enjoyed the tree
of knowledge, sexuality

362
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,713
but did not eat of its fruit.

363
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,170
Indulging in the fruit of sexuality means

364
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,353
to spill the sexual energy, to orgasm.

365
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,310
To indulge in the fruit of sexuality

366
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,270
is to taste the divine energy
that illuminates the soul

367
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,563
in order to feel physical sensation.

368
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,430
Thus the energy used to
maintain the vitality

369
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,193
of the individual is
expelled through the orgasm.

370
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,600
Without this energy, the soul atrophies,

371
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,713
breaking the connection with God.

372
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,110
This is the poisoned
apple given to Snow White.

373
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,220
While sweet to the taste
of the physical senses,

374
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,823
it is poison to the soul.

375
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,400
Eating it results in unconsciousness

376
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,650
and an eternity of sleep.

377
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,560
The universal story of maidens

378
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,320
and virtuous heroes falling asleep

379
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,040
is an allegory illustrating
the sleep of the consciousness,

380
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,230
the state in which the human being

381
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,090
loses the direct personal knowledge of God

382
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,893
in the higher realms of nature.

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,090
Thus because of the abuse
of the tree of knowledge,

384
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,663
humanity is now asleep.

385
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,450
This is why the fruit
of the tree of knowledge

386
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,023
was forbidden to eat.

387
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:35,773
- [Female Narrator] "And the
eyes of them both were opened

388
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,967
"and they knew that they were naked.

389
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,577
"And they sewed fig leaves together

390
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,567
"and made themselves aprons."

391
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,220
- [Male Narrator] This was the Genesis

392
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,180
of the distinction between good and evil.

393
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,040
A humanity that knew only goodness ate

394
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,493
of the forbidden fruit and
discovered animal desire.

395
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,860
This is the Pandora's
box of Greek mythology

396
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,670
that when opened, released
the agents of evil

397
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,633
into the world, fear,
pride, shame, et cetera.

398
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:08,257
- [Female Narrator] "And Adam said,

399
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:10,000
"'I heard that voice in the garden

400
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,710
"'and I was afraid because I
was naked and I hid myself.'"

401
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,380
- [Male Narrator] Fear and shame

402
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,120
through sex Adam gained new knowledge,

403
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,033
the knowledge of suffering.

404
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,600
In tasting the fruit, Adam learned desire.

405
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,940
From this moment, right and
wrong is filtered subjectively

406
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,907
through his need to feel
pleasure and avoid suffering.

407
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,803
- [Female Narrator] "And
Jehovah Elohim said,

408
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:51,921
"'Behold, the man has become one of us

409
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,457
"'to know good and bad.'"

410
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,570
- [Male Narrator] Humanity
had already known good,

411
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,260
innocence, purity and simplicity.

412
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,970
Now humanity discovered what
the Elohim had already known

413
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,393
that desire leads to suffering.

414
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,687
- [Female Narrator]
"Desire caused all the gods

415
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,667
"to fall from their places

416
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,097
"and it is desire who leads
all creatures to hell."

417
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,390
- [Male Narrator] Desire is craving

418
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,580
and craving is suffering.

419
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,663
Desire always leads to suffering.

420
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,117
- [Female Narrator] "Desire never rests

421
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:31,177
"by enjoyment of lust,

422
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:34,847
"as fire surely increases the
more butter is offered to it."

423
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,910
- [Male Narrator] Thus
stripped of their connection

424
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,740
to the divine, Adam and Eve as symbols

425
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,000
of humanity were cast out of
Eden to wander in a wilderness

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,437
of suffering and ignorance.

427
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,047
- [Female Narrator] "And
to the woman he said,

428
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,607
"'I will make most severe
your pains in childbirth.

429
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,983
"In pain shall you bear children"

430
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,900
- [Male Narrator] Projecting
the laws of Jehovah

431
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,940
and the guidance of the Elohim,

432
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,280
humanity attempted to
have children on its own.

433
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,740
And in the end conception
and childbirth happened out

434
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,823
of balance with nature and the
result was pain and hardship.

435
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,950
By using the sexual force
to stimulate desire,

436
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,420
the fire of Eve inverted flowing
in the opposite direction.

437
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,530
The serpent fell forming
the famous tale of Satan,

438
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,740
stimulating the seven inverted virtues,

439
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,243
the seven capital sins.

440
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,144
(gentle music)

441
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,863
Eden exists within every
soul united with God.

442
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,720
Expelling the light of God
from within expels the soul

443
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,923
from Eden and creates a great emptiness.

444
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,160
To replace the void created by
this disconnection with God,

445
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,160
mankind created civilizations,
ideas and religions,

446
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,053
seeking material, wealth,
power, and sexual satisfaction.

447
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,870
Desire for sensation became
the new God and only served

448
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,970
to further degenerate
mankind until man was left

449
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,683
with only a trace of the divine inside.

450
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,760
In story after story,
we find the enlightened

451
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,653
or empowered heroes brought
to their ruin by their lust.

452
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,490
In the Judeo Christian tradition,

453
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,993
long hair was the symbol of
sexual purity or chastity.

454
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,260
Thus when Delilah cuts the hair of Samson,

455
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,663
this is a symbol of lustful seduction.

456
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,980
And Samson lost his power

457
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,423
when he could not control
his sexual desire.

458
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,300
In the epic Indian
classic "The Mahabarata",

459
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,803
Pandu is warned never to
release the sexual energy.

460
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,120
But when tempted by a beautiful woman,

461
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,340
he proves incapable of
controlling his lust

462
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,483
and he throws away his
immortality and dies.

463
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,270
Thus humanity was exiled for Eden

464
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,300
and mankind descended into the wilderness,

465
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,300
the physical world, this third dimension,

466
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,773
the world of suffering.

467
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,487
- [Female Narrator] "He drove the man out

468
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,713
"and stationed East of the
garden of Eden the Cherubim

469
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:59,767
"and the fiery ever-turning
sword to guard the way

470
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,227
"to the tree of life."

471
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,000
- [Male Narrator] Adam and
Eve were cast out of Eden.

472
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,617
However the gateway back to Eden

473
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:10,720
and the tree of life was
neither closed nor locked.

474
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,660
Instead, Jehovah Elohim
sent angels Cherubim

475
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,803
to guard the entrance.

476
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,100
The entrance to the garden of
Eden is the same door through

477
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,290
which Adam and Eve departed.

478
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,880
Humanity is not locked out of Eden

479
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,240
but an angel is left to
grant entrance only to those

480
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,540
that have earned the right to return.

481
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,490
And only those that have
conquered the tempting serpent

482
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,103
have earned that right.

483
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,599
(bells chiming)

484
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,277
- [Female Narrator] "If you
bring forth what is within you,

485
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,707
"what is within you will save you.

486
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:57,447
"But if you do not bring
forth what is within you,

487
00:31:57,447 --> 00:32:00,170
"what is within you will destroy you."

488
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,640
- [Male Narrator] The serpent is within.

489
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,633
The serpent is the sexual fire.

490
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,390
It is a very powerful atomic
energy with a polarity

491
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,433
that can be used either
to create or destroy.

492
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,600
Because this energy is so powerful,

493
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,450
the individual requires great willpower

494
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,233
in order to overcome the
lure of this serpent.

495
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,060
The lure of his serpent
is material pleasure

496
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,523
and self edification.

497
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,450
This tempting aspect of
the serpent is Lucifer

498
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,123
or what in Hebrew is
called Shaitan, the enemy.

499
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,330
Because Shaitan is a fiery
serpent that is ignited

500
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,110
and empowered through the sexual act,

501
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,360
it is always tempting mankind to know,

502
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,073
to have the sexual connection.

503
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,363
The serpent itself is power.

504
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,140
The individual decides
through their actions

505
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,003
whether it will be a
power of good or evil.

506
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,110
It is the difference
between obeying the serpent

507
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,113
or controlling it.

508
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,860
The lesson contained in
the story of the serpent

509
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,180
is that only those with
the strength of will

510
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,650
to control the cravings

511
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,240
of their mind can raise
the energetic serpent

512
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,480
to transform themselves
from intellectual animals

513
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,943
into true human beings.

514
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,650
We must conquer the
dragon that lies within

515
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,170
as religions and mystical
traditions have told us

516
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,673
for untold ages.

517
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,570
The dragon uses lust, passion,
anger, pride, fear and envy.

518
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,203
Thus we have the Hydra of many heads.

519
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,853
In the Medusa, the deceptions
of this circuit are Legion.

520
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,050
The great heroes and gods
always have the serpent

521
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,760
under their power and it is
the serpent who protects them

522
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,393
and conquers their enemies.

523
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,330
In contrast to Eve being tempted

524
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,050
by the serpent causing her to fall,

525
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,620
Moses commanded the serpent

526
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,453
and conquered the Egyptians
accomplishing great miracles.

527
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,830
The Egyptians had
degenerated into black magic

528
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,803
and Moses came to deliver
the true teachings.

529
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,390
The Hebrew Mem signifies water,

530
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,830
Shin is fire

531
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,153
and He is the womb.

532
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,460
So the name Moshe or Moses
means born of fire and water.

533
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,670
The Aztec Christ Quetzalcoatl

534
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,253
and the Tibetan Padmasambhava
were both born of the waters.

535
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,310
Moses then was born again

536
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,850
which means that he
created the soul symbolized

537
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,270
by the illuminated tree of life,

538
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,773
the burning Bush that he
saw in the wilderness.

539
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,400
The enlightened tree unified
him with his inner father.

540
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,723
Thus he received the
commands of God directly.

541
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,263
Moses needed to free the
people of Israel from Egypt.

542
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,470
Israel is a compound word.

543
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,653
Is is from ISIS, the
Egyptian divine mother,

544
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,270
rah is the Egyptian divine father

545
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,633
and el is Hebrew for God.

546
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,010
In this story, Israel symbolizes
the consciousness trapped

547
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,683
in the sinning mind of man.

548
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,130
He was told to take the
rod, the spinal column,

549
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,550
the tree of life in his own
body and it became a serpent,

550
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,423
the serpent of the Kundalini.

551
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,420
His serpent was more powerful
than the negative serpent

552
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,390
of the Egyptians.

553
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,713
Thus symbolizing the
duality of the sexual force.

554
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,390
Only the positive
serpent under the service

555
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,483
of God can free the soul from suffering.

556
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,800
Sex can be lustful or chased.

557
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,260
Sex can create or destroy.

558
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,470
Sex can be animal or worshipful.

559
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,840
Sex can raise a fiery chariot to heaven

560
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,793
or pave a road to the abyss.

561
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,210
Sex is a natural function
of the human being

562
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:56,040
but only sex as performed under
the guidance of divine will.

563
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,750
Sex performed under the guidance

564
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,750
of the mind creates suffering,
pain and spiritual death.

565
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,070
This is self-evident in those
who seek happiness in sex.

566
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,740
As with any desire of the mind,

567
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,780
sexual desire can never be satisfied

568
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,957
- [Female Narrator] "Through
the abandonment of desire,

"'who know good and bad.'"

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,210
- [Male Narrator] Whether the
individual is in love or lust,

578
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,130
the serpent is powerful

579
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,860
because all of the blood is circulating

580
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,693
with that fire within the body.

581
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,180
And when two people unite sexually,

582
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,010
the internal polarity is
balanced and enhanced.

583
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,730
A tremendous energy is excited
that permeates the couple

584
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,940
with the power to create.

585
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,430
This is the fire of the
Holy spirit as demonstrated

586
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,663
by the tongues of fire
raised above the apostles.

587
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,030
This is Shin, the fire of God,

588
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,563
the fire of the Holy Spirit
and the fire of Christ.

589

In this connection,

the couple is appreciating
the tree of knowledge to know.

591
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,980
To conquer the desire of the orgasm

592
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,403
is to conquer the tempting serpent of Eve.

593
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,710
As the serpent is always
on the tree of knowledge

594
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,540
of good and evil, this is
the only place to conquer it

595
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,843
and gain true knowledge through sexuality.

598
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,390
- [Male Narrator] Humanity
left Eden as a couple

599
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,163
and as a couple must return.

600
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,990
This is illustrated in the
ancient acknowledgement

601
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,040
of the need for both
priests and priestess,

602
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,020
the couple that must work together

603

in order to reach perfection.

604
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,800
Couples that conquer the desire to eat

605
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,043
of the fruit of knowledge gather
internally all that energy.

606
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,330
And gradually that energy can be used

607
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,423
to create something inside.

608
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,670
Rather than feeding their own lust,

609
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,403
they can restore their own
inner Eve, the fallen serpent.

610
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,493
And from there raise the
serpent of the Kundalini.

611
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,910
They can aluminate the
tree of life which exists

612
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,630
within the human body, the spinal column

613
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,280
and they can create divine
light within themselves

614
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,913
and return to the direct
knowledge of their own inner God.

615
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,760
This is why all

616
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,313
of the world's great
religions emphasize chastity.

617
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,570
Chastity does not mean
abstention from sex.

618
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,840
It means abstention from the orgasm,

619
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,967
from spilling the divine
energy that is the Holy spirit.

for spiritual advancement it is necessary.

For it is through this
energy that the vehicle

of the human soul is born.

631

This is what is meant when
the biblical Jesus explains

636
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:03,277
"and that which is born
of the spirit is spirit."

637
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,240
- [Male Narrator] He must give
birth internally to his soul

638
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,853
from the water and the spirit.

639
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:14,387
- [Female Narrator] "With patience,

640
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:16,717
"ye shall possess thy souls."

641
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,650
- [Male Narrator] Jesus
of Nazareth never said

642
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,890
that the soul already exists within a man.

643
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,890
Instead he said it must be born
of the water and the spirit.

644
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,933
In all of God's creation
everything is born of sex.

645
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,190
Thus the soul, the fiery
chariot of heaven must also

646
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,083
be born of sex.

647
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,290
The soul must be born in us,
born of the waters of sex

648
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,753
and the fire of the spirit.

649
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,350
When Jesus met the
Samaritan woman at the well,

650
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,163
he told her of a water
that gives eternal life.

651
00:41:57,793 --> 00:41:59,857
- Female Narrator] "The
woman saith unto him,

652
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:02,927
"'Sir, give me this water
that I may not thirst

653
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,717
"'nor come hither to draw.'"

654
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,670
"Jesus saith to her,

655
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,370
"'Go, call thy husband and come hither.'"

656
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,723
- [Male Narrator] He was prepared

657
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:14,250
to tell her the secret of Alchemy,

658
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,260
that the waters of eternal life,

659
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,143
the fountain of youth is developed
between husband and wife.

660
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,607
But she was not faithful to one man

661
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,653
and thus she was not worthy
to receive the true teaching.

662
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:29,900
- [Female Narrator] "But a man

663
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,217
"who commits adultery lacks judgment,

664
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,517
"whoever does so destroys himself."

665
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,510
- [Male Narrator] It is
very revealing to see

666
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,380
that when Adam, Yah and
Eve, Heva are joined

667
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,510
to the sexual fire represented
by the character Shin,

668
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:51,393
the result is Yahshua, Jesus the savior.

669
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,900
Jesus of Nazareth incarnated
the fire of the Christ

670
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,443
just as did Moses,

671
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Krishna, Mohammed, Quetzacoatl,

672
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,677
Baldur, Zoroaster, Fuxi

673
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,363
Hercules, Mithras, Osoros

674
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,993
and many others.

675
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,930
The Christ is a universal
energy that saves those

676
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,703
who are pure enough to receive it.

677
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,870
Man and wife

678
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,533
through immaculate sexuality
create their own salvation.

679
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:01,902
(mid tempo orchestral music)

680
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,670
The containment and the transmutation

681
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,530
of the potent sexual energy

682
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,590
can restore the fallen serpent of Eve.

683
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,270
From there, the fire of the
Holy spirit can be awakened,

684
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,403
raising the serpent upon the staff.

685
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:25,730
This is the Kundalini, the
positive life giving serpent.

686
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,410
It can only be awakened through chastity

687
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,920
and by husband and wife.

688
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,483
A single person cannot
awaken the Kundalini.

689
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,030
The Kundalini is not a
blind mechanical force.

690
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,560
It is the active intelligence of God

691
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,760
and can only manifest

692
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,670
in those who purify themselves
of all that is against God,

693
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,453
pride, envy, lust, greed, et cetera.

694
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,243
The fire of the Kundalini
awakens only with moral progress.

695
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,607
- [Female Narrator] "Unless
your righteousness exceeds

696
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:06,857
"that of the scribes and Pharisees,

697
00:45:06,857 --> 00:45:09,467
"you will never enter
the Kingdom of Heaven.

698
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,687
"You, therefore must be perfect

699
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,607
"as your heavenly Father is perfect."

700
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,050
- [Male Narrator] Every Hebrew letter

701
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,350
also represents a number

702
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,633
thus every Hebrew word
has a numeric value.

703
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,590
The letters that spell Adam
also give the numbers one,

704
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,433
four and 40.

705
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:41,869
- [Female Narrator]
"And I heard the number

706
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,717
"of those sealed 144,000 from
all the tribes of Israel."

707
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,370
- [Male Narrator] Only those
who have restored the innocence

708
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,313
of Adam in themselves will return to Eden.

709
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,890
The secret to become the perfect Adam

710
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,170
is in the ninth sphere,

711
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,993
Yesod the foundation
stone, the sexual waters.

712
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,880
The fire of the sexual energy must create

713
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,303
or it will destroy.

714
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,517
This very potent energy
cannot be contained

715
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:24,550
and if repressed will seek
expression destructively,

716
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,880
internally through the mind, through anger

717
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,653
or through sexual degeneration.

718
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,110
This is evidenced by
the infamous perversions

719
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,650
of priests, monasteries and
convents around the world

720
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,140
in all religions, in
the rampant fanaticism

721
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,483
that has destroyed so
many spiritual movements.

722
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,970
Abstention from sex is just
another form of sexual abuse.

723
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,230
It is very destructive
to the inner psychology

724
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,323
of the human being.

725
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,710
In order to utilize the
sexual energy effectively,

726
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,533
it must be transmuted
into spiritual energy.

727
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,940
This is accomplished by
connecting sexually with a spouse

728
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,510
without spilling the
energy through the orgasm

729
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,400
or if one is single learning

730
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,100
to control the energy through
ancient methods long forgotten

731
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,823
by contemporary priests.

732
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,320
Adam must be born in us
from the sexual water

733
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,800
and the fire of the Holy spirit

734
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,123
otherwise we cannot return to Eden.

735
00:47:32,987 --> 00:47:34,927
- [Male Narrator] "No one
whose testes are crushed

736
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:37,327
"or whose member is cut
off shall be admitted

737
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:40,037
"into the congregation of Jehovah."

738
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,960
- [Male Narrator] Entrance back into Eden,

739
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,150
the congregation of the Lord

740
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,593
is through the proper use of sexuality.

741
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,770
Likewise, the entrance
into suffering and pain

742
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,453
is through the improper use of sexuality.

743
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,820
Sex can be used to create good in us

744
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,513
or it can be used to create evil in us.

745
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,583
It is up to us to decide,

746
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,240
do we want to serve the
virgin or the whore?

747
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,240
We cannot serve two masters,
love and lust can never mix,

748
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,623
God cannot mix with a devil.

749
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,130
This is the sixth card of the terror

750
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,673
and we choose our path by our action.

751
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,890
These are the two primary
types of tantrism,

752
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,133
black and white.

753
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,220
Stimulation of sexual
sensation in identification

754
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,320
with lust is black tantra.

755
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,287
Any school or religion that teaches

756
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:49,430
how to awaken through having the orgasm

757
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,383
is teaching black tantra.

758
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,570
White tantra always teaches three factors,

759
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,020
the elimination of desire,

760
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,913
the creation of the soul
and sacrifice for others.

761
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,530
All white tantra teaches

762
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,083
to renounce the orgasm.

763
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,223
This is the road back to Eden.

764
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:16,270
Mankind must return to Eden
through same door it exited.

765
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,930
Anyone who wants to be
healed of the damage caused

766
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,640
by the tempting serpent must be healed

767
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,863
as the Israelites were by
the bronze serpent of Moses.

768
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,860
Bronze is an alloy of two metals,

769
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,913
copper and tin, masculine and feminine.

770
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,100
The bronze serpent is created

771
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,170
when the two polarities are
brought together in purity.

772
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,210
This is the great secret
knowledge of Alchemy,

773
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,764
the chemistry of God.

774
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:51,650
Al or L is God.

775
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,733
Kimia means to fuse or cast a metal.

776
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,550
So Alchemy is the method

777
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,993
to fuse ourselves once again with God.

778
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:03,277
- [Female Narrator]
"You will succeed at it

779
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:06,177
"if you take pains to
be what you should be,

780
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:11,077
"that is to say pious,
gentle, benign, charitable

781
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:12,237
"and fearing God."

782
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,910
- [Male Narrator] To acquire
true spiritual awakening,

783
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,310
it is necessary to use the
polarities of Adam and Eve

784
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,350
within the human body to
defy the tempting serpent

785
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,850
and raise the fire of the Holy spirit

786
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,633
to create the human soul.

787
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,270
This is the key to the
ancient mystery of Alchemy

788
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:38,070
to transmute the lead
of the ego and desire

789
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,203
into the spiritual gold
of the consciousness.

790
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,100
When the sexual fire of Yesod
is elevated to the knowledge

791
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,000
of Daath, we returned
to the direct knowledge

792
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,833
of our own inner star,
the light of the world.

793

- [Female Narrator] "And Elohim said,

794
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,307

and there was light."

was created with a light
